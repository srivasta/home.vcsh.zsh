 ## watch for my friends
 ## An array (colon-separated list) of login/logout events to report.
 ## If it contains the single word `all', then all login/logout events
 ## are reported.  If it contains the single word `notme', then all
 ## events are reported as with `all' except $USERNAME.
 ## An entry in this list may consist of a username,
 ## an `@' followed by a remote hostname,
 ## and a `%' followed by a line (tty).
watch=(notme)

 ## The format of login/logout reports if the watch parameter is set.
 ## Default is `%n has %a %l from %m'.
 ## Recognizes the following escape sequences:
 ## %n = name of the user that logged in/out.
 ## %a = observed action, i.e. "logged on" or "logged off".
 ## %l = line (tty) the user is logged in on.
 ## %M = full hostname of the remote host.
 ## %m = hostname up to the first `.'.
 ## %t or %@ = time, in 12-hour, am/pm format.
 ## %w = date in `day-dd' format.
 ## %W = date in `mm/dd/yy' format.
 ## %D = date in `yy-mm-dd' format.

# If nonnegative, commands whose combined user and system execution times
## (measured in seconds) are greater than this value have timing
## statistics printed for them.

#  %%     A `%'.
#  %U     CPU seconds spent in user mode.

#  %P     The CPU percentage, computed as  (%U+%S)/%E.
