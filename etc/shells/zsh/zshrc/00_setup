# the difference between `SAVEHIST' and `HISTSIZE' thanks to the
# FAQ. `HISTSIZE' is the number of lines of history that is kept
# within any given, running zsh. `SAVEHIST' is the number of lines of
# history that is written out to a file at the magic, mysterious
# moment when that event occurs. so cat-ing `HISTFILE' into wc -l
# should enumerate the number of history events

#              The  maximum  number  of  events  stored in the internal history
#              list.  If you use  the  HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST  option,  setting
#              this  value larger than the SAVEHIST size will give you the dif-
#              ference as a cushion for saving duplicated history events.
HISTSIZE=1000
SAVEHIST=65536
#              The file to save the history in when an interactive shell exits.
#              If unset, the history is not saved.
